# Master-Control-Program

This MCP’s main goal is to run and schedule programs. An input file is used containing a variety of valid and non-valid programs (mostly valid). Those programs are then run as process and scheduled accordingly. 

This project was split into 4 parts: 
part 1 – launching the workload and having all the processes run together
part 2 – starting and stopping processes using signals
part 3 – scheduling processes using alarm
part 4 – accessing /proc to display information
Each part builds off the other
